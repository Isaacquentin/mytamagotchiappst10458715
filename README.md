**INTRODUCTION TO MOBILE APPLICATION AND DEVELOPMENT (IMAD5111)**

**PURPOSE**

> *The goal of the app is to provide a fun and educational experience
> for children by simulating the responsibility of caring for a virtual
> pet. Aimed at teaching children about animal care, the app offers an
> adorable digital companion that requires the user\'s attention and
> care. When the animal is tired, hungry or wants to play, it sends
> messages encouraging the child to interact and respond to its needs.
> Through this engaging interface, children learn the importance of
> education and responsibility while enjoying fun interactions with
> their virtual friends. Additionally, the app incorporates educational
> elements such as basic animal care tips and fun facts to further
> enhance the learning experience. With its approach that is both
> entertaining and informative, the app encourages empathy and
> compassion towards animals among young users.*
